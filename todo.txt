TESLA MODEL S MAINTENANCE COSTS
    There was a thread started on the Tesla Forum boards regarding what the maintenance fee would be per year for the Model S. 
    I called a couple stores today and was surprised to find out they still don't know what the maintenance fee was or if there was any at all. 
    One store said it would be $300/year and the other store said $1200/year because you needed 2 checkups per year. I was under the assumption that
     the upkeep and repair of the Model S would be far lower than an ICE car, so am surprised/confused that the maintenance fee would be anything above 
     $200-$300 per year. at $500+, that seems like a premium to normal maintenance costs of an ICE, not a discount. Does anybody know what the yearly 
     maintenance fee is going to be if anything at all? Thanks

     I asked this question at the WDC event today and was told $600 per year.

     I believe in the video of the shareholders meeting, Elon said $50/month. (x 12 = $600/year).

     Considering I will be saving over $3k a year on gas alone, paying $600 for maintenance that is mostly done at your own home or place of work (which tesla has repeatedly talked about) is well worth it.

     Assuming they do multiple software upgrades and monitor the vehicles, someone has to pay the programmers and the people who handle the alerts from the monitoring systems. 
     $600 seems "high but bearable" if there really are frequent software updates (one every four to five weeks).

     The BMW 550 I purchased in 2006 (first year for that engine) came with 3 years of free maintenance. Dealer updated various software components three times 
     (each event took 2-3 hours of shop time). Replaced several sets of wipers at no charge. Fixed minor rattles twice. No charge for any of this. This is what I would expect from Tesla.
    Of course, the next three years of ownership had $1500 brakes, $1800 transmission oil pan, $150 oil changes x 3, etc. THATS where our real savings will be.
